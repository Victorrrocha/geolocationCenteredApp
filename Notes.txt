How to sign the apk?
Generating a signing key
keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias my-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
Will prompt for:
    - passwords for the keystore and key
    - Distinguished Name fields for your key

Will generate:
    - my-release-key.keystore

Note: Remember to keep your keystore file private and never commit it to version control.
Add to git ignore

Setting up gradle variables
1. Place the my-release-key.keystore file under the android/app directory in your project folder.
2. Edit the file ~/.gradle/gradle.properties or android/gradle.properties and add the following 
(replace ***** with the correct keystore password, alias and key password),

MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE=my-release-key.keystore
MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=my-key-alias
MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=*****
MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=*****

Adding signing config to your app's gradle config
Edit the file android/app/build.gradle in your project folder and add the signing config,

...
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig { ... }
    signingConfigs {
        release {
            if (project.hasProperty('MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE')) {
                storeFile file(MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE)
                storePassword MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD
                keyAlias MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS
                keyPassword MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD
            }
        }
    }
    buildTypes {
        release {
            ...
            signingConfig signingConfigs.release
        }
    }
}
...

Generating the release APK
cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease
